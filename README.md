## Commercial usage

I've changed the license regarding commercial usage. Yes, commercial usage is granted and you can do whatever you need with the library. However, you will *have* to share any kind of modifications you make to the library (if you improve or fix something), making sure to do it generic enough so we all (including you) benefit from it.

Backwards compatibility from commit to commit is granted to an extent. Bear in mind that sometimes I might refactor some stuff and its usage might change, however, it doesn't seem to happen that often, only when I'm adding some new functionality.
